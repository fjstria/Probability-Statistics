# Probability-Statistics
These projects were adapted from assignments given in CSE 107 (Probability and Statistics for Engineers) taught by Chen Qian at UC Santa Cruz. My implementations were programmed using Python3.

## Projects
* `BloomFilter` - Implementation of a Bloom Filter used to predict malicious URLs.
* `NaiveBayesClassifier` - Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier used to predict spam emails.
