## Details
Starter code for the functions `load_data()`, `word_set()`, `accuracy()`, `main()`, and the `NaiveBayes` class were provided to all students. The functions `fit()` and `predict()` were self implemented. This is an implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier.

## Usage
While in the `NaiveBayesClassifier` directory within the terminal, type `python3 naive_bayes.py`. This will run
the program and output the accuracy of the classifier.
