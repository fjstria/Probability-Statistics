## Details
This project was originally submitted as an assignment given in CSE 107 (Probability and Statistics for
Engineers) taught by Chen Qian at UC Santa Cruz. Starter code for the functions `hash()`, `main()`, and the
`BloomFilter` class were provided to all students. The functions `add()` and `contains` were self implemented.
This is an implementation of a Bloom Filter.

## Usage
While in the `BloomFilter` directory within the terminal, type `python3 bloom_filter.py`. This will run the
program and output the false positive rate of the bloom filter.
